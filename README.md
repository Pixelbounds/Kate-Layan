## Todo:
1. Add more support for languages: HTML, CSS, JS, Python, R, Bash
2. Fine tune some of the colors and how they interact visually with each other.
3. More language support: Lua, PHP, YAML, JSON, C, C++, C#

This editor is based on the Layan theme, unsupported languages are using Tokyo Night in this pack. Feel free to PR if you want to add support for your language of choice.
